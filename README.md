# meep
Translates meep-based communications into English

## meep meep: functions
1) user inputs text consisting solely of "mee" or "meep" (ui consists of two buttons, one that says "meep" and one that says "mee", and user presses buttons repeatedly to create a string of mee's and meep's. 

2) programme returns English language sentences with appropriate number of words

3) ???

4) humour

### meep meep meep: how?

The translator takes the length of the input string (number of words/number of meeps) and returns an english-language string of the same word-length. There is no actual difference between inputs of "mee" and inputs of "meep" to what the translation actually does, but the user doesn't know that I guess. 

Every X translations there is an "easter egg" -- for example, the translation just returns the input but with Mee(p)s turned into Bee(p)s.
